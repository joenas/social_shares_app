# social_shares_app
Sinatra app to get social share counts for an URL, from different networks.  
Based on [social_shares](https://github.com/Timrael/social_shares), but with my own fork since threads turned out to be not so memory safe. Working on fixing that..  
Works very good with [dokku](https://github.com/dokku/dokku)!
